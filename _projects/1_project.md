This was made as a part of my final year project, I used C# and the Unity game engine. The system uses Perlin noise to create the cave system. The idea behind it was designed
to be used by people to make caves for there games  

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/1P2.JPG" title="A cave chunk" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

<div class="caption">
    This image showcases a bit of the cave generated.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="assets/video/CaveGen.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
