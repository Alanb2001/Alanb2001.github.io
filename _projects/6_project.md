A couple of weeks after graduating from university, I got to work at Psycho Hound/Roughneck Studios as a freelance junior game programmer. I worked with them for three months before leaving, and it taught me a lot about working in the industry and a lot about networking with Unreal Engine while making gamplay features.

I had a great time working for the company and learned a lot while there. My main role was to make gameplay mechanics for two multiplayer games. Most of my time was spent making gamplay features for a game that was being made that was similar to Dead by Daylight. One mechanic that I made was to be able to hide in lockers, and while making this, I had to keep in mind that I would have to replicate the gamplay mechanic so it would look right to other players near by. Near the end of my time with the company, I worked on Ruff ‘N’ Tumble to make extra minigames with the other programmers. Here is a link to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1190740/Ruff_N_Tumble_Mayhem/">Steam page </a> for the game.
