This was made in the final year of university. In this project, the goal was to make post-processing effects work on our project.  

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/4P2.JPG" title="OpenGL Scene" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This image showcases the rendered scene.
</div>

This was the second time I used OpenGL, and the goal this time around was to get more objects in the scene, have multiple lights working at the same time, and add some post-processing effects. The post-processing effects I chose to implement were anti-aliasing and depth of field.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include video.html path="assets/video/Real-TimeGraphics.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" controls=true autoplay=true %}
    </div>
</div>
