This was a second year project, we were tasked with making a game engine using a template provided by the lecturer.  

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/5P2.JPG" title="The game" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

The game engine was made using C++ and nothig else, this was mostly built from scratch with the use of the template provided. The engine is capable of making
2D games, most of the systems implemented in the project had been created in a that doesn't interfere with making a game with the enigne, such has being able to display
sprites and other things.
