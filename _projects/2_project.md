This project was made during our second year of university. It was composed of a team of seventeen people. This was during COIVD, so we used Discord to communicate. I was responsible for the AI found in the game.

This game was made using Unreal Engine 4. There are three different types of enemies in this game, the first being a basic enemy that just walks towards the player and attacks. The second enemy is a slow-moving, hard-hitting enemy that, when it gets close to the player, charges in that direction. The final enemy is a floating, teleporting type of enemy that throws projectiles at the player.
